# Workout App

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run: npm install
3. Run: npm run dev

## Built With:

Node and MonogDB Atlas for the backend.  
React for the frontend.

## Vision

For this application my goal was to create a workout application that would be easy to use and supply the user with helpful information. Only the user will be able to see their information. The user can keep track of their workouts and how their body may change over time.

## User Stories:

1.  User should be able to create an account
2.  User should be able to sign into their account
3.  User can create their body specifications to their profile
4.  User can update any of their body specifications
5.  User can create a lifting workout
6.  User can update a lifting workout
7.  User can delete a lifting workout
8.  User can create a cardio workout
9.  User can update a cardio workout
10. User can delete a cardio workout

## Future Updates

One update I would like to implement is for the user to track their daily calorie consumtion. This would allow the user to see their caloric intake on a daily basis. I would also like to change up the styling and make it more user friendly.

## What I've Learned

One of the most important things I learned developing this application is that deadlines are essential. This was also my first full stack application using nothing but JavaScript. It was intresting working with Node and MongoDB Atlas. I learned alot about how MongoDB Atlas works.
